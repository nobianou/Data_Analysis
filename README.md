# Data_Analysis - Price prediction of smarphones
The goal of this project is predict the price of smartphones based on different parameters mentioned  on mobile specification. It will help the consumers to know if they are paying the best price for their smartphones.
Prediction Model 1 : K-Nearest Neighbors 
Finding the best n-value for the model
Determining how well the training and test data compare in term of Mean Square Value
Using the score method to determine how well the model predicts the price
Prediction Model 2 : Random Forest
Used two different n-values to test and find the better parameter
Using the score method to determine how well the model predicts the price
Determining how well the training and test data compare in term of Mean Square Value
Based on comparing those things, I would say K-nearest Neighbor Model is the best at predicting the mobile phone price, with the least Mean Square Value and higher accuracy in predicting the mobile phone price
