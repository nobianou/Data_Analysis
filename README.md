# Data_Analysis - Price prediction of smarphones
The goal of this project is predict the price of smartphones based on different parameters mentioned  on mobile specification. It will help the consumers to know if they are paying the best price for their smartphones.
Prediction Model 1 : K-Nearest Neighbors 
  Finding the best n-value for the model
  Determining how well the training and test data compare in term of Mean Square Value
  Using the score method to determine how well the model predicts the price
Prediction Model 2 : Random Forest
  Used two different n-values to test and find the better parameter
  Using the score method to determine how well the model predicts the price
  Determining how well the training and test data compare in term of Mean Square Value
  Based on comparing those things, I would say K-nearest Neighbor Model is the best at predicting the mobile phone price, with the least Mean Square        Value and higher accuracy in predicting the mobile phone price

# Data assessment and exploratory data analysis of Airbnb Data

>why you are interested in this data

  I am intrested in this data because it provides valuable insights of Airbnbs' listing activity and metrics in NYC

>where you found the dataset (including link)

  The dataset can be found at: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

      how many rooms are being rented in a building

      the number of occupants allowed in a rental

      whether the listing is licensed





What is the structure or shape of the data?

    With rows and columns in shape, and saved in CSV fomat the structure of the data is rectangular

What is the granularity of the data?

    The data seems complete, for instance the geolocation has been divided into two separate columns.

What is the scope and completeness of the data?

    The data is complete and covered all the boroughs in NYC.
